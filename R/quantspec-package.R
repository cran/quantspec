#' @section Contents:
#' The \pkg{quantspec} package contains an hierachy of S4 classes with
#' corresponding methods and functions serving as constructors. The following
#' class diagrams provide an overview on the structure of the package. In the
#' first class diagram the classes implementing the estimators are implemented.

#' \if{latex}{\figure{main.pdf}{options: width=15cm}}
#'
#' In the second class diagram the classes implementing model quantities are
#' displayed. A relation to the ``empirical classes'' is given via the fact that
#' the quantile spectral densities are computed by simulation of quantile
#' periodograms and a common abstract superclass \code{QSpecQuantity} which
#' is used to provide a common interface to quantile spectral quantities.

#'
#' Besides the object-oriented design a few
#' auxiliary functions exists. They serve as parameters or are mostly for
#' internal use. A more detailed description of the framework can be found in
#' the paper on the package (Kley, 2014b).
#'
#' @section Organization of the source code / files in the \code{/R} folder:
#' All of the source code related to the specification of a certain class is
#' contained in a file named \code{Class-[Name_of_the_class].R}. This includes,
#' in the following order,
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item all roxygen \code{@@include} to insure the correctly generated
#'         collate for the DESCRIPTION file.
#'   \item \code{\\setClass} preceded by a meaningful roxygen documentation.
#'   \item specification of an \code{initialize} method, where appropriate.
#'   \item all accessor and mutator method (i. e., getter and setter); first
#'         the ones returning attributes of the object, then the ones returning
#'         associated objects.
#'   \item constructors; use generics if there is more than one of them.
#'   \item \code{show} and \code{plot} methods.
#' }
#'
#' @section Coding Conventions:
#' To improve readability of the software and documentation this package was
#' written in the spirit of the ``Coding conventions of the Java Programming
#' Language'' (Oracle, 2014). In particular, the naming conventions for classes
#' and methods have been adopted, where ``Class names should be nouns, in mixed
#' case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.'' and
#' ``Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase,
#' with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.''
#'
#' @section Naming Conventions for the Documentation:
#' To reflect the structure of the contents of the package in the documentation
#' file, the following system for naming of the sections is adopted:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Documentation of an S4 class is named as the name of the class
#'         followed by ``-class''. [cf. \code{\link{QuantilePG-class}}]
#'  \item Documentation of a constructor for an S4-class is named as
#'         the name of the class followed by ``-constructor''.
#'         [cf. \code{\link{QuantilePG-constructor}}]
#'  \item Documentation of a method dispaching to an object of a certain
#'         S4 class is named by the name of the method, followed by ``-'',
#'         followed by the name of the Class.
#'         [cf. \code{\link{getValues-QuantilePG}}]
