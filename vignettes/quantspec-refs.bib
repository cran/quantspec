  abstract = {Two tests for serial dependence are proposed using a generalized spectral
	theory in combination with the empirical distribution function. The
	tests are generalizations of the Cramer-von Mises and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
	tests based on the standardized spectral distribution function. They
	do not involve the choice of a lag order, and they are consistent
	against all types of pairwise serial dependence, including those
	with zero autocorrelation. They also require no moment condition
	and are distribution free under serial independence. A simulation
	study compares the finite sample performances of the new tests and
	some closely related tests. The asymptotic distribution theory works
	well in finite samples. The generalized Cramer-von Mises test has
	good power against a variety of dependent alternatives and dominates
	the generalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A local power analysis explains
	some important stylized facts on the power of the tests based on
	the empirical distribution function.},

  title = {Hypothesis Testing in Time Series via the Empirical Characteristic
	Function: A Generalized Spectral Density Approach},
  journal = {Journal of the American Statistical Association},
  year = {1999},
  volume = {94},
  pages = {1201--1220},
  number = {448},
  abstract = {The standardized spectral density completely describes serial dependence
	of a Gaussian process. For non-Gaussian processes, however, it may
	become an inappropriate analytic tool, because it misses the nonlinear
	processes with zero autocorrelation. By generalizing the concept
	of the standardized spectral density, I propose a new spectral tool
	suitable for both linear and nonlinear time series analysis. The
	generalized spectral density is indexed by frequency and a pair of
	auxiliary parameters. It is well defined for both continuous and
	discrete random variables, and requires no moment condition. Introduction
	of the auxiliary parameters renders the spectrum able to capture
	all pairwise dependencies, including those with zero autocorrelation.
	The standardized spectral density can be derived by properly differentiating
	the generalized spectral density with respect to the auxiliary parameters
	at the origin. The consistency of a class of Parzen's kernel-type
	estimators for the generalized spectral density is established, and
	their optimal convergence rates are derived using the integrated
	mean squared error criterion. A data-dependent asymptotically optimal
	bandwidth (or lag order) is introduced. The kernel estimators and
	their derivatives are applied to construct a class of asymptotically
	one-sided N(0, 1) tests for generic serial dependence and hypotheses
	on various specific aspects of serial dependence. The latter include
	serial uncorrelatedness, martingale, conditional homoscedasticity,
	conditional symmetry, and conditional homokurtosis. All of the proposed
	tests, which include Hong's spectral density test for serial correlation,
	can be derived from a unified framework. An empirical application
	to Deutschemark exchange rates highlights the approach.},

  volume = {41},
  pages = {313--351},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Outliers in time series can play havoc with conventional power spectrum
	density estimation techniques when the spectrum features of interest
	consist of one or more peaks of relatively low amplitude. Furthermore,
	the outliers need not be large relative to the scale of the process
	in order to have considerable impact on the estimate; they only need
	to be large relative to the scale of the innovations process. Following
	a tutorial review of the central notions of robustness and the principles
	guiding conventional spectrum estimation, methods are presented for
	computing robust spectral densities. These are quite insensitive
	to such outliers and produce reliable estimates reflecting the structure
	of the core portion of the data. Two distinct methods are described.
	Both are based on robust prewhitening and on weighting the resulting
	residuals. They differ only in the way prewhitening is done: the
	first method computes the prewhitened values iteratively through
	a filtering operation; the second fits a robust autoregressive representation
	to the data by iterated weighted least squares. Each approach can
	be regarded as the solution to an intuitively appealing minimization
	problem, where the solution is exact in one case, approximate in
	the other. Both procedures have proved to be successful over a wide
	variety of data sets as will be demonstrated with real and simulated
	data.},
