  abstract = {A new type of periodogram, called the Laplace periodogram, is derived
	by replacing least squares with least absolute deviations in the
	harmonic regression procedure that produces the ordinary periodogram
	of a time series. An asymptotic analysis reveals a connection between
	the Laplace periodogram and the zero-crossing spectrum. This relationship
	provides a theoretical justification for use of the Laplace periodogram
	as a nonparametric tool for analyzing the serial dependence of time
	series data. Superiority of the Laplace periodogram in handling heavy-tailed
	noise and nonlinear distortion is demonstrated by simulations. A
	real-data example shows its great effectiveness in analyzing heart
	rate variability in the presence of ectopic events and artifacts.},
