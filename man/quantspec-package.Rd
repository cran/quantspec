\section{Contents}{

The \pkg{quantspec} package contains an hierachy of S4 classes with
corresponding methods and functions serving as constructors. The following
class diagrams provide an overview on the structure of the package. In the
first class diagram the classes implementing the estimators are implemented.

\if{latex}{\figure{main.pdf}{options: width=15cm}}

In the second class diagram the classes implementing model quantities are
displayed. A relation to the ``empirical classes'' is given via the fact that
the quantile spectral densities are computed by simulation of quantile
periodograms and a common abstract superclass \code{QSpecQuantity} which
is used to provide a common interface to quantile spectral quantities.

Besides the object-oriented design a few
auxiliary functions exists. They serve as parameters or are mostly for
internal use. A more detailed description of the framework can be found in
the paper on the package (Kley, 2014b).

\section{Organization of the source code / files in the \code{/R} folder}{

All of the source code related to the specification of a certain class is
contained in a file named \code{Class-[Name_of_the_class].R}. This includes,
in the following order,
\enumerate{
  \item all roxygen \code{@include} to insure the correctly generated
        collate for the DESCRIPTION file.
  \item \code{\\setClass} preceded by a meaningful roxygen documentation.
  \item specification of an \code{initialize} method, where appropriate.
  \item all accessor and mutator method (i. e., getter and setter); first
        the ones returning attributes of the object, then the ones returning
        associated objects.
  \item constructors; use generics if there is more than one of them.
  \item \code{show} and \code{plot} methods.
}
}

\section{Coding Conventions}{

To improve readability of the software and documentation this package was
written in the spirit of the ``Coding conventions of the Java Programming
Language'' (Oracle, 2014). In particular, the naming conventions for classes
and methods have been adopted, where ``Class names should be nouns, in mixed
case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.'' and
``Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase,
with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.''
}

\section{Naming Conventions for the Documentation}{

To reflect the structure of the contents of the package in the documentation
file, the following system for naming of the sections is adopted:
\itemize{
  \item Documentation of an S4 class is named as the name of the class
        followed by ``-class''. [cf. \code{\link{QuantilePG-class}}]
 \item Documentation of a constructor for an S4-class is named as
        the name of the class followed by ``-constructor''.
        [cf. \code{\link{QuantilePG-constructor}}]
 \item Documentation of a method dispaching to an object of a certain
        S4 class is named by the name of the method, followed by ``-'',
        followed by the name of the Class.
        [cf. \code{\link{getValues-QuantilePG}}]
}
